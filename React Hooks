A Hook is a regular javascript function.

1) useState hooks

*useState is a hook allow us to use react feature of state without making a class component.
console.log(useState(value)) => returns an array with two values.
[value //current value of state,  function() //to update current value of state]

* using setState in class components- only change the updated value of state
* using setState in Hooks- replace the whole state object and other properties will be undefined

2)useEffect hooks

*It accepts a function as an argument, this function is called effect
*Every time the component re rendered, the function is re declared and also for the initial render
